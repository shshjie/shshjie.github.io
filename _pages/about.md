I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Yau Mathematical Sciences Center](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). I am on the job market currently.

I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2022 under the supervision of Lawrence Ein. Before that, I studied math at Nanjing University and Peking University.

Apart from that, I enjoy watching movies. The [China Film Archive](https://www.cfa.org.cn) is my favourite place in Beijing.
