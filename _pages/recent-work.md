  * S. Shang, et al., StepFun-Prover Preview: Let's Think and Verify Step by Step, Technical Report, arXiv:2507.20199 
      * I led the end-to-end research and development of the StepFun-Prover Preview.
      * We introduced and validated a new pattern: tool-integrated reasoning, significantly enhancing the capabilities of formal reasoning models.
      * We successfully implemented a tool-integrated reinforcement learning strategy to train the model from a cold start.
      * StepFun-Prover can achieve strong performance in generating Lean 4 proofs with minimal sampling. Specifically, StepFun-Prover-Preview-32B achieves a pass@1 success rate of 70% on the miniF2F-test benchmark.
